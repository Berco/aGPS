<p><h1><i><u>BackGround</u></i></h1></p>

<p>
Here we can easily type something about this nice app
</p>
<p>
On my other apps I have a welcome screen explaining how the app must be used. However, most people dont
read it, so in this section I use to have some more background information.
</p>

<p><i>
We have root!<br />
And the first three files are now on your phone!<i></p>

<p>
At startup of this demo app we gained root and three files are now located in<br />
/data/data/by.zatta.agps/files
</p>

<p>
They have different names than they will get when we copy them to /system/etc/. This will be done
by a shell script because that is where we need the root for.
