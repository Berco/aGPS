<p><h1><i><u>Welcome!</u></i></h1></p>

<p>
<b>Please read this carefully!</b>
</p>
<p>
<p><i><b>The app.</i></b> <br />
This app does installs a customized gps.conf file for your GPS. It has several 
different profiles to choose from. <b>We recommend to use the default Google profile</b> 
but it is up to you. Appart from the profiles you can customize the one chosen.
</p>

<p><i><b>NTP server.</i></b> <br />
Derek Gordon maintains a special NTP server for you. Dispite what everyone thinks, it is 
not necessarily the one closest to you which is the best. We consider Derek Gordon's server 
to be the best option to choose because it has the best data and is most frequently updated. <br />
For more information about the NTP server check out the "About this app" section found under the 
settings of this app. Also, feel free to visit derekgordon.com for more in depth information.
</p>

<p><i><b>Donations</i></b> <br />
To maintain the server we need money. Donations through this app will be devided between Derek Gordon 
and Zatta. Each star costs 2 Euro and will reduce the waiting time before you can install the patch. 
0 star users wait 20 seconds, 1 star users 10, 2 star users only 5 and 3 star users and Premium users 
can install immediately. <br />
<b>You can become a premium user for only 5 Euro. This is a discount of 1 euro compared to a 
three star user!</b>
We choose this method to allow every one to use all features of this app and because we believe in 
XDA developers users. Please, don't leech!
</p>

<p><i><b>Backup and restore</i></b><br />
On the first run of this app a backup is made on your SD card. <b>Don't remove it</b> because a 
backup is only made during the first run (or at an update if you choose to remove it anyway) and no 
other backup is found on your SD card.
</p>

<p><i><b>ROM updates</i></b><br />
The patch this app provides is located on your /system partition so every time you do update your ROM the 
patch is overwritten and you will have to redo the patch. <br />
Unless you are using a Cyanogenmod based ROM and your rom has addon.d support. In that case a script will be 
placed in the addon.d directory to preserve the patch. <br />
It can be disabled in the app's settings but is enabled by default.
</p>

<p><i><b>Asus users</i></b> <br />
On ASUS roms a typical file is present at /system/etc/gps, namely the gpsconfig.xml file. This app 
pathes that file as well, to be specific the PeriodicTimeOutSec parameter. Of course a backup is made of 
this file as well.
