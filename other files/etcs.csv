NTP_SERVER|NTP IS NETWORK TIME PROTOCOL AND PROVIDES A TIME-HACK TO DEVICES THAT HAVE SYNCING  MADE READLIY POSSIBLE.  MANY XDA PATCHES MISINTERPRET WHAT NTP IS AND IMPORTANCE. NTP PACKETS HAVE BUILT-IN MECHANISMS FOR  TRANSMISSION LOSS.  NTP PACKETS ARE VERY SMALL.  LASTLY, NTP MATTERS FOR PARSING THE XTRA.BIN.  BUT, IT ONLY MATTERS WHEN YOUR DEVICE HAS ITS TIME EXTREMELY OFFSET COMPARED TO REALITY.  THUS, I BUILD THIS PATCH FOR WORLDWIDE OPERATION.  RARELY WOULD LOCAL NTP SERVERS BE REQUIRED.|ntp.derekgordon.com|ntp.derekgordon.com|ntp.derekgordon.com
AGPS|AGPS AND XTRA TELL THE AGPS DAEMON WHERE  IT MAY LOCATE THE AGPS DATA.  THE DATA  OPERATES AS AN ALMANAC WITH THE LOCATION  OF GPS SATS STORED WITHIN IT.  THIS DATA  IS ONLY VALID FOR 24 HOURS.  IT WILL BE  DOWNLOADED AND CACHED.  IT IS NO LONGER  KEPT IN THE /DATA/ PARTITION PERMANTENTLY.  THERE IS NO POINT TO KEEP IT THERE!  MY SERVER PROCESSES THE XTRA.BIN EVERY 30  MINUTES.  TYPICALLY IT UPDATES EVERY HOUR  WHEN NEW DATA IS AVAILABLE.
